# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Initial Django Project
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Django project repository with recommended structure, including apps, core, templates, static, and media directories. Set up Docker and Nginx configurations for local development.
# Details:
Create a new Django project using Django 4.2 or later. Organize the project as per the PRD directory structure. Set up Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized development. Configure Nginx for static file serving. Use Python 3.10+ and Django 4.2+ for best compatibility and security. Initialize git repository and add .gitignore for Python/Django projects.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project creation by running the development server and accessing the default Django welcome page. Test Docker build and run commands to ensure containers start without errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Repository and Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Git repository with proper .gitignore and create the Django project with recommended structure
### Details:
Create a new Git repository and initialize it with a comprehensive .gitignore file for Python/Django projects. Create the Django project using the latest compatible version. Organize the project structure following best practices with separate directories for apps, core functionality, templates, static files, and media. Include unit test directory structure.

## 2. Containerize Django Application [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for the Django application
### Details:
Write a Dockerfile that properly sets up the Python environment, installs dependencies, and configures the Django application. Create a docker-compose.yml file that defines services for Django, PostgreSQL database, and Redis for caching. Include volume configurations for data persistence and proper networking between containers. Add environment variable configuration through .env files.

## 3. Configure Nginx Reverse Proxy [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up Nginx for serving static/media files and routing requests to Django
### Details:
Create Nginx configuration files to serve as a reverse proxy for the Django application. Configure proper routing for static and media files. Set up SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections. Ensure proper caching headers and compression settings. Add the Nginx service to the docker-compose.yml file with appropriate links to the Django service.

## 4. Implement Automated Testing Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure with test cases
### Details:
Implement unit tests for Django models, views, and forms. Create integration tests for API endpoints. Set up test fixtures and factories for consistent test data. Configure test coverage reporting. Implement automated UI testing if applicable. Ensure tests can run both locally and in CI/CD pipeline.

## 5. Implement CI/CD Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment workflow
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD workflow files. Configure pipeline stages for linting, testing, building Docker images, and deployment. Set up automated security scanning for dependencies and Docker images. Configure deployment to staging and production environments with proper approval gates. Implement rollback mechanisms for failed deployments.
